# Robot App

Robot App has developed is  the context of multiple research projects for autonomous robots. During experiments, Robot App is a very useful tool. I add something when it is requierred by a new research project. This is the child of the Robot Contoller and it has build because it was very hard to have a laptop during test at external location. A smatphone is enough and provides the most of the functions of the Robot Controller.

## Features

* Navigation Joysticks for multiple robots.
* Multicameras live feed.
* SLAM map.
* Open Street Map.
* ROS logs.
* Multiple buttons for configuration.
* Operation times.
* Robot status and battery.
* Robot PC status (CPU, RAM, etc.)
